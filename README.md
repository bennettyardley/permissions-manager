# permissions-manager
A cool way to manage permission in Linux by assigning user temporary rights, when they need it.

# client.py
Allows a user to request permissions to a certain folder

# server.py
Allows a operator to accept or deny requests from users

## To Do
* Add error checking for the inputs in client.py
* Set some default values for client.py
* Better checking for status updates in client.py
* GUI with tkinter
* ACL commands for server.py
