# permissions-manager
A cool way to manage permission in Linux by assigning users temporary rights, when they need it. In a real world situation the database would be hosted with the server and the client would have to connect, but both are local for this project.

# client.py
Allows a user to request permissions to a certain folder

# server.py
Allows a operator to accept or deny requests from users

## To Do
* ACL commands for server.py 
* Improve the readme with required packages and more details
* Improve functions for easier to read code
* Improve text and spacing in print statements
